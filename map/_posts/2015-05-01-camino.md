So this trip was a post college trip with some of my closest friends!  Overall it was a smashing success, 10 years later, the Ruta Vadinense was really a highlight.  I thoroughly enjoyed all of the north and i think fondly on the time in the south was well, but the "specialness" was certainly in that order.  Finnesterre is a wonderful finish to make it to the western tip! by the end of the month you are in good enough shape where you can really enjoy a couple net downhill days to the coast.

The Camino Del Norte:

As of writing of writing this the Camino Frances is still the most popular, however the North felt really cool! There is a lot more elevation as you are following a rugged coastline, Really interesting regions with strong ethnic identities (basque and astorias).  Overall it is super beautiful and has the yellows everywhere so you cant get lost.  

Ruta Vadiniense:

This rute is much less popular but really cool! a nice way to shoot through the mountains and see rugged parts of spain south of the Picos.  Folks are very very excited to see pilgrams here and super welcoming.  At one point the albergue we stayed was just an apartment that barkeep gave out to pilgrams at night!

Camino Frances:

The classic, it was packed! and continues to be packed.

Routa Finnesterre:
