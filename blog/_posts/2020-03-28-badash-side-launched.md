Ok I finally know what I want to blog about:
(foods left behind by the immigrant populations in the us)

- difference in chinese vs korean for example
- tibet (only the dali llama sect came over?
- bengalis have been here for a long time, why no kati rolls? 
- grocery stores per culture: only like 4 thai grocer's but a resturant on every corner, meanwhile japanese grocers are really pervasive all over the city
- why no malaysian resturants?
