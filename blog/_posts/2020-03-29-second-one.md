So lets focus for a moment on the countries which I have more access to the immigrant population (east/south asian in queens, then latine america -- Central asian I think is much stronger represented in the southern BK area, but I need to see if that is true).  Juset a start lets look at rates of the various groups in NY over time to start thinking about intuition (or is this just a bias?)  for timing and what not to start to get to get an idea of what questions are possible/easier to answer.  (before we do foods left behind).

the [NYC Gov](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/Fact-Sheet-NYCs-API-Immigrant-Population.pdf) put out a pretty solid overview of modern immigration into NYC in the past 20 years, and there some interesting observations to be made from it:
 - As a percentage increase, API folks (not just immigrants!) in NYC has gone up 250% in the last 30 years! compare that with the other groups we have black: ~0%, hispanic:37% and white:-37%.  Now in absolute terms this tells quite a different story, we have API folks at (+1.2mm), Hispanic at (+1.1mm) and White at (-1mm).  So we need to do some research into the resturant breakdown of NYC and see what that reflects, as a lot of pressures change whether folks are able to or want to make resturants for their specific heritage.
 - Unsurprisingly given the state above it looks like an API is 2x more likely (need to stat check this) to have been born in another country then any other race.
 - I need to figure out how to get this graph in here, but in NYC vs the rest of America, we have way more Chineese folks as a percentage (49.7% vs 23.7%), The biggest differences in the other direction are Vietnameese (NYC: 1.2% vs USA:10.1%) and Filipino (NYC: 18.0% vs USA:24.3%) so what is up with that?
 - In the last 10 years Koreans (71k->55k) and Japanese(16k->15k) net emigrated from NYC (only API group to do so) and Bangledeshi's almost doubled! (27k->53k) (NOTE: the chart this is for API immigrants, not american's! not sure what that means, but it certainly means somthing (probably second gen+3rd gen?, but certainly  reduction in active immigration).  Some obvious follow ups here:
   - Japanese are at 1.9% of the NYC population, but (2.5% of the entire US) -- obviously their food is "over respresented" in pop culture, this is well explored, find some good articles to link that here.
   - Will we start to we more Eastern-Indian/Bangledeshi cuisine pop up?
