I have never been to Bhutan.  These are most likely not at all authentic.  They incredibly tasty and based of off a recipe a friend brought back who lived in Bhutan for 4 months.

<h2>Bhutanese Inspired Cheese Momo</h2>
Ingredients
<ul>
  <li>2 onion </li>
  <li>4 gloves of garlic </li>
  <li>250g of queso fresco (or like 280, one of them discs)</li>
  <li>250g of parm, shredded </li>
  <li>500g of greens (spinach or kale)</li>
  <li>Dumpling wrappers: either buy your own or follow <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/vegetable-dumplings/"> here </a> </li>
</ul>

Steps
<ol>
  <li>Blanch the greens, then squeeze out all of the water and chop it finely</li>
  <li>Saute onion and garlic (normal oil is fine but I like to add some ghee or butter to up the savoriness</li>
  <li>mix all ingrediants in a bowl, it should be pretty dry, no water pooling at the bottom.  At this point you can freeze some of the filling and make the rest of the dumplings later </li>
  <li>put them into the wrappers</li>
  <li>At this point you have three options:
  <ul>
    <li>Freeze them for later</li>
    <li>Steam them</li>
    <li>(This is more like gyoza style) Put them in a lightly oiled pan, once they are browning throw ~60ml of water in it, cover it and let the water boil off and then let the bottoms crisp up a bit more.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


Ingredients: The sauce
<ul>
  <li>1 onion </li>
  <li>4 gloves of garlic </li>
  <li>10g ginger </li>
  <li>10g tumeric </li>
  <li>X birds eyes chilis to taste </li>
  <li>2 fresh tomatoes (or like 3 of the little canned ones)</li>
  <li>1 tbpn either Chiangkiang or cheap balsamic vinegar </li>
  <li>1 tbpn light soy sauce</li>
</ul>

Steps: The sauce
<ol>
  <li>Saute onions until translucent</li>
  <li>Add garlic, tumeric, ginger, chilis, saute until golden brown  </li>
  <li>Drop in tomatoes </li>
  <li>Reduce to it being thick (just shy of applesauce, so when it cools down itll be like applesauce) </li>
  <li>Blend it (I use a handblender cause its hot, but if you got a blender that can handle that all the better) </li>
  <li>Add the soy sauce and the vinegar and mix it up</li>
</ol>
