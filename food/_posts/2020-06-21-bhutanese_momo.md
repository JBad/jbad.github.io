I have never been to Bhutan.  These are most likely not at all authentic.  They incredibly tasty and based of off a recipe a friend brought back who lived in Bhutan for 4 months.

<h2>Bhutanese Inspired Cheese Momo</h2>
Ingredients
<ul>
  <li>2 onion </li>
  <li>4 gloves of garlic </li>
  <li>250g of queso fresco (or like 280, one of them discs)</li>
  <li>250g of parm, shredded </li>
  <li>500g of greens (spinach or kale)</li>
  <li>Dumpling wrappers: either buy your own or follow <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/vegetable-dumplings/"> here </a> </li>
</ul>

Steps
<ol>
  <li>Blanch the greens, then squeeze out all of the water and chop it finely</li>
  <li>Saute onion and garlic (normal oil is fine but I like to add some ghee or butter to up the savoriness</li>
  <li>mix all ingrediants in a bowl, it should be pretty dry, no water pooling at the bottom.  At this point you can freeze some of the filling and make the rest of the dumplings later </li>
  <li>Light Soy Sauce </li>
