Such a good salad, maybe the best -- the crunchies + ginger + toasted chickpea powder are the key -- working on recipes for those parts, but assembly is functionally trivial.  Apperently it is really easy to make the pcikled ginger (its not like western/japanese pickled ginger), but I think you need to use younger ginger so it isnt so stringy. The countries have fava beans, mung beans, chana dal?, seasame seeds, peanuts, and garlic, but how they stay so freaking crunchy is a mystery until i run out of my stash and need to figure out how to make them.

1 cup pickled ginger
1.5 cups shredded napa cabbage, squeezed and pressed flat
3/4 cup the best fried means Myanmar has to offer
1/4 cup fried garlic (big)
1 tomato chopped (or 2)
1-4 green birds eye chill chopped small
1/4 cup peanuts
Lime juice to taste
Fish sauce to taste
2 TBSP of toasted chickpea flour
