<h2>Hidromel</h2>
So this may be the biggest success we have had in fermenting.  Working on a sweet collab with 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/timrulz54">Tims Vlog</a>.  I had had some really good hidromel (like mead beer) when I was Toledo, 
I had not seen anything like it here in the states, (maybe I wasnt looking).  It was incredibly honey forward, and not sweat, 
I'm not sure I fully realized how honey would taste if you took out (or let a yeast eat) all of the sugars. Turns out it is pretty great!  
We start our first experiment with 3 gallons and the following three blends:
<ul>
  <li>1lb of honey : 1 gallon of water</li>
  <li>1.5 lb of honey, 1 cup of raisons : 1 gallon of water</li>
  <li>2 lb's of honey, 3 apples worth of apple peels chopped up : 1 gallon of water</li>
</ul>

After about 5 weeks, the first one was completely clear and dead, the apple skins still chugging a long.  We bottled them all and upon tasting I think 
that the apple skin was a favourite, with the raisins and the original not far behind
