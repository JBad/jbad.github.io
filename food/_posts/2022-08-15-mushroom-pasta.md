<h2>Mushroom Pasta</h2>
Ingredients
-3 shallots
-chopped-80-100g of microplanned pecorino romano
-2tsbp of butter
-3tsbp of EVOO
-1 lb of fresh pasta
-30g of dried mushroom (hedgehog/chanteralle/morel)
-fresh ground black pepper

Steps:
1. take mushrooms put them in a mug and fill with boiling water, let sit for ~30 minutes
2. melt butter + evoo in a pan, add shallots.  Blast to high and then reduce to low and simmer while the mushrooms soak.
3. Drain the mushrooms (save the liquid!) then chop to your desired size
4. add mushrooms to shallots move to medium high.
5. add mushroom soaking liquid to shallots, boil of until you are mostly dry but nothing is burning 
6. Get some salted boiling water ready, add pasta, cook it
7. scoop pasta into the bowl with the other stuff, add cooking liquid to get a sauce going.
8. wait a bit for the pasta to cool before adding the cheese or itll clump, but then add the cheese pinch at a time (like 6 or 7 pinches) total saving just enough to sprinkle the remaining on top

some fun additions:
-i roast some broccoli and toss that in
-finely chopped sun dried tomatoes thrown in (think of more like a topping cheese)

I find my self making this a lot cause i get a bag of fresh pasta once a week, ill either do vodka pasta/pasta ala norma or cacio e pepe.  But I often end up making this cause it is easy and tasty and I bought waay to many dried mushroom last year.
