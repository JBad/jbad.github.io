A standard and delicious breakfast food in Myanma/Burma.  And truly a gem.  It is amazing with chicken (replace the boiled potato with boiked, shredded), but also dynamite with boiled potato, sometime Ill throw some butter in or fry it in ghee for richness, but really it should be light! Thoke means "Salad" (but like kinda more like how laab means salad, so like better then like a stupid sweet green salad).  Everything is really really easy to find in America excdepot for toasted chickpea flour (I think, I know most south asian grocers have untoasted chickpea flour, once I run out of my current stash I will have to investigate that more and will report back.

servse 4-5 (standard american portions)

For the curry: 
 - Boil rectangles of 1-2 potatoes (1.5cm x 1.5cm x 5cm -- ish)
 - Chop 1 onion + 4 close garlic (grated) + 1 inch ginger (grated)
 - Heat oil + turmeric add alliums (onions first)
 - Add chili powder
 - At the end add potatoes, sugar (to taste, fish sauce (to taste)


3 hard boiled eggs sliced
1/4-1/2 cup sliced cabbage
1 sliced shallot (soaked in water for 20 min)

For assembly: 
 - udon noodles(thickest you can find) (I do 21 oz) (~4 portions)
 - fried shallots
 - fried garlic
 - cabbage
 - 2-3 chopped eggs (once per person - 1)
 - lime juice
 - more fish sauce
 - toasted chickpea flour (NOT OPT)
 - scallions (opt)

Toss super well, plate with last egg
