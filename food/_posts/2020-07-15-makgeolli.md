This is more accurately "Non specific rice beer"

I would say my first shot was much more successful then I originally thought.  I will continue to experiment with the following things:
<ul>
 <li>Using sticky rice or other forms of rice</li>
 <li>Using left over mash from the previous cycle to use less yeast balls</li>
 <li>Other grains (millet, wheat, etc</li>
<ul>


<h2>Non Specific Rice Beer</h2>
Ingredients (for about a 1L yield)
<ul>
  <li>1 cup Rice</li>
  <li>2 yeast balls (I am going to try with one, not sure what the ideal ratio is here)</li>
  <li>1 tsp of bread yeast (this was my insruance policy, I dont think you need it and I will update this with out that once I am successful)</li>
</ul>

Steps
<ol>
  <li>Cook rice, take it out, wait for it to cool complete</li>
  <li>morter and pestle the shanghai yeast ball into a powder, mix it in with the rice</li>
  <li>Fill up 1.5 L (I used two jars) with the rice, then top off with water, let it ferment for 3-5 days, I burped it a couple of times a day.  Try to keep it cool (<70F) or it may get sour according to the internet but I havent confirmed this (also I added a tsbp of wheat flower here, but I am not sure if is necesaary</li>
  <li>using cheesecloth, drain, then wring it as dry as possible to get as much of the milky goodness out.</li>
  <li>bottle into something you can seal, you can add some honey or sugar for more bubbles, do a second ferment in the fridge for 3 more days</li>
  <li>be weary upon opening it can fizz up a lot! I enjoy this drink on ice</li>
</ol>
