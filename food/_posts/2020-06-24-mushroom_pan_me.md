Again we are copying Kedai Makan.  Or at least we are trying to.

<h2>Mushroom Pan Mee</h2>
Ingredients
<ul>
  <li>500g mushroom (any kind you like, I like to mix at least two, lastime I made it with oyster and shimeji and it came out great)</li>
  <li> 3 shallots, finely chopped (or you can sub onoins but i prefer shallots)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Light Soy Sauce </li>
  <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 tsp white vinegar </li>
  <li>2 tbsp butter or oil </li>
  <li>1.5 tsp sugar </li>
  <li>100g greens (green greens, not like bok choi, but like spinach or gai lan (chopped) or something </li>
  <li>fried shallots </li>
  <li>1 egg/pp</li>
  <li>fresh wheat noddles (i like the kind you can get at like hmart or any korean store, but there are plenty of option out there)</li>
</ul>

Steps
<ol>
  <li>coursely chop the mushrooms (to your size preference, for this dish I like to keep the mushroom texture so i make it like 1.5 cm cubes)</li>
  <li>put oil in a pan, add shallots until translucent</li>
  <li>put on medium high toss mushrooms, try to brown the edges but keep structure (so like a higher heat then a saute  but not quite a quick stir fry)</li>
  <li>put in soy suace, vinager, sugar, stir, reduce a bit and so it isnt like swimming in it but not a dry fry (you want leftover sauce to run down the noodles</li>
  <li>Cook noodles</li>
  <li>blanch greens for the right amount of time (spinach is like a second, gai lan is like a minute</li>
  <li>Poach an egg, if you cant poach an egg(/only have one pot like me), just fry it sunny side up or over easy</li>
  <li>In a bowl, place noodles, put mushrooms on a third, greens on a third, shallots on a third (make it looks like a very even pie chart, and then the poached egg in the middle</li>
  <li>Serve with a nice chili oil and if you want a sipping broth</li>
</ol>

experimentation with new dried mushroom: chiken of the woods, matsutake, king bolete and morel coming soon (probably just chicken of the woods and matsutake, not going to use morels here.
