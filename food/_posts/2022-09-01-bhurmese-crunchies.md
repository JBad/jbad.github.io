Ok folks, so laphet thoke and gin thoke are my favourite salads, hands down.  Besides panzanella and som mamuang, 
I really dont desire salads on a regular basis.  But for those 4, I do, quite often in fact!

Fermenting tea leaves seems tricky (I have tried, need to give it a nother shot for sure but in the past it has been more of an oil-y pickle? -- Its does seem that you can use dried and then brewed tea leaves which is nice).
The ginger for gin thoke is an open mystery as well.  I pickle gari at home quite often but the texture of the little squiggles of ginger is beyond my skill, I have tried cutting it against the grain and with the grain! maybe I need to use younger/fresher ginger, will continue and if I get it I will report back.

As you can tell, this post is mostly a failing so far :p -- but I have finally cracked something that I think will be helpful.

The crunchies, these seem to be an absolutely essential to any Bhurmese salad.  They also happen to be aboslutely amazing and delicious and nutrious. 
They are an assortment of fried (or toasted) beans and seeds that add some volume and crunch to any salad.  So for the longest time I was stumped by
these larger flatter beans.  Fava beans seems to be the key.  Now you can buy bags of these crunchies and they seem to be airtight and store for a 
while and retain their crunch... so why cant we?  This is be an ongoing project but having found similar looking beans at the egyptian grocery, 
I am invigorated to give it at try (along with some toor dal/chana dal/seasame seeds and some peanuts.  Ill get photos next time I try the crunchies 
and report on my frying escapades. for my first attempt I am thinking:
 - 3-5 hour soak of the fava + dal
 - 3-5 minute fry?

I also recently saw people rapid cook then toast beans (this was for mung dal on top of mango sticky rice -- maybe this will also yield nice crunch? standby for the answer.
