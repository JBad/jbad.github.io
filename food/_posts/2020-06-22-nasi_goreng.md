<h2>Nasi Goreng</h2>
Ingredients
<ul>
  <li>3 cups day(s) old cooked rice</li>
  <li>5 cloves of glaric</li>
  <li>250g (about 1) finely chopped onion</li>
  <li>30g (about 5 cloves) crushed,  chopped (same size as onion) garlic</li>
  <li>Protein: At the moment I dont really cook meat so I dont know what do for that
    <ul>
      <li>Tofu: I like to cut these into like long rectangles (1x1x4) then fry the outsides and then slive it into 1cm think slices.</li>
      <li>Paneer: Nothing traditional here, I cut them into like 1-2cm cubes, fry them, then toss them in salt, curry powder and a bit of sugar</li>
      <li>Mushrooms: I used to do this alot but it kinda takes over a bit if you arent careful.  I used to use oysters, it was quite nice but changed the feeling of the dish.  Im sure a nice shimeji would be good or some shitaake or crimini, just toss it in post onions/garlic pre rice </li>
      <li>Chicken: This would probably be great, just havent tried it, but mix it with some cornstarch and soy sauce I guess then lightly fry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1 cup packed leafy greens (cut up if using big leafy green, but if you are rocking like baby spinach as is fine)</li>
  <li>X birds eye chilies (optional, you know yourself)</li>
  <li>neutral higher heat (not olive) oil</li>
  <li>Sweet Soy Sauce (also known as Kejap Manis, my favourite by far is the <a href="https://www.templeofthai.com/food/sauces/blacksweetsoy-5132222035.php"> dragon fly brand</a> but in a pinch healthy boy will do but is inferior.  Note: This is Sweet Soy Sauce, NOT Black Soy Sauce, if you are buying on you may as well get the other but make sure you use the right one here. </li>
  <li>Dark Soy Sauce (still not black)</li>
  <li>Light Soy Sauce </li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp Curry Powder: specifically <a href="http://www.efooddepot.com/products/tl-bon-con-voi-corp/5698/tl-bon-con-voi-corp-curry-powder-hot-(ca-rin-ni--hy--cay)--hy--2oz.html"> this one </a> If you need one and cant find it near you, let me know and I can ship it to you (if you are in the lower 48). </li>
  <li>2 Scallions</li>
  <li>Fried Shallots (surprisingly not optional :P)</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cucomber slices lengthwise (garnish, optional)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup per person of pickled greens (garnish optional)</li>
</ul>
Steps:
<ol>
  <li>prep your protein</li>
  <li>add some oil, saute onion (first, itll go slower then the garlic), garlic until golden brown.  (Add chilies now if fresh)</li>
  <li>add curry powder</li>
  <li>add more oil, turn to high, just before smoking crumble in rice</li>
  <li>add protein</li>
  <li>now this is the choose your own adventure step depending on your preference of salty:sweet.  The ratio I prefer is 4 : 1 : 1 of sweet : light : dark soy sauce.  usually 4 TSBP of sweet, 1 TBSP of light and 1 TBSP of dark.  You want to mix it up good </li>
  <li>Wok Hei: You are probably at home with a lame stove like me, so I just hang out and let the bottom get a bit browned get some maillard going, and dont let it get burned but it adds a lot to the final product (if you are on a proper wok burner, Im jealous)</li>
  <li>Fold in the greens</li>
  <li>Turn off heat, let it sit for a second</li>
  <li>Plating:
    <ol>
      <li>get another pan and fry an egg, basically sunny side up (but I do over easy)</li>
      <li>get a plate, and a small soup bowl, using the wok tool pack the bowl</li>
      <li>flip plate onto the bowl, then flip both together so plate is down and remove bowl</li>
      <li>slide the egg right on top</li>
      <li>add cucomber on the side</li>
      <li>add the pickles on the side</li>
      <li>sprinkle shallots all over</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>



Nasi Goreng is the king of all fried rices.  Fools may thing otherwise but they have simply not yet seen the light.  I was first introduced to this dish at Kedai Makan one of my favourite restaurants in Seattle.  It is Indonesian/Malaysian by origin.  Things I added/changed that I like are:
<ul>
  <li>the usage of Paneer as a protein it if fun and a bit differnt, but heats up like shit so if you are planning on making a bunch, tofu is much better the next day.</li>
  <li>adding pickles, its a pretty heavy meal, its dark (both in flavour and colour) and very different from chineese style egg fried rice, having a bright vinegery side really compliments it nicely.</li>
</ul>
