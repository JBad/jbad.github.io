PUT THE RECIPE HERE nobbody gives a shit about your experience with this dish.
<h2>Nasi Goreng</h2>
Ingredients
<ul>
  <li>3 cups day(s) old cooked rice</li>
  <li>5 cloves of glaric</li>
  <li>250g (about 1) finely chopped onion</li>
  <li>30g (about 5 cloves) finely chopped garlic</li>
  <li>Protein: At the moment I dont really cook meat so I dont know what do for that
    <ul>
      <li>Tofu: I like to cut these into like long rectangles (1x1x4) then fry the outsides and then slive it into 1cm think slices.</li>
      <li>Paneer: Nothing traditional here, I cut them into like 1-2cm cubes, fry them, then toss them in salt, curry powder and a bit of sugar</li>
      <li>Chicken: This would probably be great, just havent tried it, but mix it with some cornstarch and soy sauce I guess then lightly fry<li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1 cup packed leafy greens (cut up if using big leafy green, but if you are rocking like baby spinach as is fine)</li>
  <li>X birds eye chilies (optional, you know yourself)</li>
  <li>neutral higher heat (not olive) oil</li>
  <li>Sweet Soy Sauce (also known as Kejap Manis, my favourite by far is the <a href="https://www.templeofthai.com/food/sauces/blacksweetsoy-5132222035.php"> dragon fly brand</a> but in a pinch healthy boy will do but is inferior.  Note: This is Sweet Soy Sauce, NOT Black Soy Sauce, if you are buying on you may as well get the other but make sure you use the right one here. </li>
  <li>Dark Soy Sauce (still not black)</li>
  <li>Light Soy Sauce </li>
</ul>

Nasi Goreng is the king of all fried rices.  Fools may thing otherwise but they have simply not yet seen the light.  I was first introduced to this dish at Kedai Makan one of my favourite restaurants in Seattle.
